<!--# Examples-->

There's nothing more intriguing than a good example. To provide guidance we tried to categorize our examples by difficulty. Categorization is opinionated and just tries to pave an entry path into `kalasim` API.

Simple

* [Traffic](examples/traffic.md) - Car navigate through a simple traffic model with crossings and traffic-lights. Clearly, they need to refill, but there is just a limited number of slots as the gas station.
* [Bank Office with 1 clerk](examples/bank_office.md#simple-bank-office-1-clerk) - A classic queue, where customers arrive at a bank and need to be serviced

Moderate

* [Movie Theater](examples/movie_theater.md) - A big cinema, great movies. How long does it take before tickets are sold out?
* [Car Wash](examples/car_wash.md) - A car wash with limited throughput, and a continuous stream of new customers
* [Machine Parts](examples/machine_parts.md) - A small shop-floor with multi-part machines, where all parts must be functional to avoid tool downtime
* [Machine Shop](examples/machine_shop.md) - A day in a life of a busy maintenance engineer. Tools break and need to be repaired before they can continue operation

Elaborate

* [ATM](examples/atm_queue.md) - The canonical queue model. Here, illustrated with a cash machine that needs to serve customers.
* [Gas Station](examples/gas_station.md)
* [Bank Office with Resources](examples/bank_office.md#bank-office-with-resources)
* [Bank Office with States](examples/bank_office.md#bank-office-with-states)
