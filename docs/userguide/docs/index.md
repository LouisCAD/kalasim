`kalasim` is a [discrete event simulator](theory.md#what-is-discrete-event-simulation) that enables complex, dynamic process models. It provides a statically typed API, dependency injection, modern persistence, structured logging and automation capabilities.

`kalasim` is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), is designed around suspendable [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) for process definitions, runs on the [JVM](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk) for performance and scale, is built with [koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) as dependency wiring framework, and is using [common-math](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) for stats and distributions. See [acknowledgements](about.md#acknowledgements) for further references.

One cornerstone of successful discrete event simulation is visualization. `kalasim` is agnostic regarding a  visualization frontend, but we provide bindings/examples using [plotly.kt](https://github.com/mipt-npm/plotly.kt), [lets-plot](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin) as well as [kravis](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kravis).

In contrast to many other simulation tools, `kalasim` is neither low-code nor no-code. It is _code-first_ to enable change tracking, scaling, refactoring, CI/CD, unit-tests, and the rest of the gang that makes simulation development fun.


## Core Features

`kalasim` is a generic [process-oriented](theory.md) discrete event simulation (DES) engine.

* [Simulation entities](component.md) have a generative process description that defines the interplay with other entities
* There is a well-defined rich process interaction vocabulary, including [hold](component.md#hold), [request](component.md#request), [wait](component.md#wait) or [passivate](component.md#passivate)
* An [event trigger queue](basics.md#event-queue) maintains future action triggers and acts as sole driver to progress simulation state
* Built-in [monitoring](monitors.md) and [statistics](analysis.md) gathering across the entire API

## First Example

Letâ€™s start with a very simple model. The example demonstrates the main mode of operation, the core API and the component process model implemented in `kalasim`. We want to build a simulation where a single car is driving around for a some time before arriving at its destination.

```kotlin
//{!api/Car.kts!}
```

Curious about an in-depth analysis of this example? It's your lucky day, see [here](examples/car.md).
