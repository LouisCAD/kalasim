# Welcome to `kalasim`

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/holgerbrandl/github/kalasim/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/holgerbrandl/github/kalasim/_latestVersion)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/holgerbrandl/kalasim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/holgerbrandl/kalasim) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/kalasim.svg)](https://gitter.im/kalasim/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

`kalasim` is a discrete event simulator that enables complex, dynamic process models. It provides a statically typed API, dependency injection, modern persistence, logging and automation capabilities.

`kalsim` is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), runs on the [JVM](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk) for performance and scale, is designed on top of [koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) as dependency injection framework, is using [common-math](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) for stats and distributions, modern event tracking and persistence, and [plotly.kt](https://github.com/mipt-npm/plotly.kt), [lets-plot](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin) as well as [kravis](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kravis) for visualization.

In contrast to many other simulation tools, `kalasim` is neither low-code nor no-code. It is _code-first_ to enable change tracking, scaling, refactoring, CI/CD, unit-tests, and the rest of the gang that makes simulation development fun.


## Core Features

`kalasim` is a generic [process-oriented](theory.md) discrete event simulation (DES) engine.

* [Simulation entities](component.md) have a generative process description that defines the interplay with other entities
* There is a well-defined rich process interaction vocabulary, including [hold](component.md#hold), [request](component.md#request), [wait](component.md#wait) or [passivate](component.md#passivate)
* An [event trigger queue](basics.md#execution--process-model) maintains future action triggers and acts as sole driver to progress simulation state

## First Example

Letâ€™s start with a very simple model, to demonstrate the basic structure, process interaction, component definition and output.

We want to build a simulation where a single car is driving around for a some time before arriving at its destination.

```kotlin
//{!Cars.kts!}
```

<!--This example corresponds to the `Cars` `salabim` example https://www.salabim.org/manual/Modeling.html-->

The example demonstrates the main mode of operation, the core API and the component state model implemented in `kalasim`. In the examples section you can find an [extended cars example](examples.md#extended-cars) that ded-cars) that is integrating more elaborate  `kalasim` concepts such as [states](state.md) and [resources](resource.md).


The main body of every `kalasim` model usually starts with:
```
createSimulation(enableTraceLogger = true){
...
}
```
Here, we enable trace logging of state changes to see the status of simulation on the console.

For each (active) component we (can) define a type such as:

```kotlin
class Car : Component()
```

The class inherits from `org.kalasim.Component`.

Although it is possible to define other processes within a class,
the standard way is to define a generator function called `process` in the class.
A generator is a function with at least one `yield` statement. These are used in the `kalasim` context as a signal to give control to the sequence mechanism.

In this example,

```kotlin
yield(hold(1.0))
```

gives control, to the sequence mechanism and *comes back* after 1 time unit. We will see later other uses of yield like `passivate`,
`request`, `wait` and `standby`.

In the main body an instance of a car is created by `Car()`. It automatically gets the name *Car.0*.
As there is a generator function called process in Car, this process description will be activated (by default at time now, which is 0 here). It is possible to start a process later, but this is by far the most common way to start a process.

With :

```kotlin
run(5.0)
```

we start the simulation and get back control after 5 time units. A component called *main* is defined under the hood to get access to the main process.

When we run this program, we get the following output (displayed as table for convenience):

```
time      current component        component                action      info                          
--------- ------------------------ ------------------------ ----------- -----------------------------
.00                                main                     DATA        create
.00       main
.00                                Car.1                    DATA        create
.00                                Car.1                    DATA        activate
.00                                main                     CURRENT     run +5.0
.00       Car.1
.00                                Car.1                    CURRENT     hold +1.0
1.00                               Car.1                    CURRENT
1.00                               Car.1                    DATA        ended
5.00      main
Process finished with exit code 0
```

There are plenty of other more advanced (that is more **fun**!) examples listed in [examples](examples.md) chapter.
