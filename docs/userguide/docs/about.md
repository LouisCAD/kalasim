`kalasim` started off as a blunt rewrite of [salabim](https://www.salabim.org/). and we are deeply thankful for its permissive licence that enabled setting up this project. A great starting point was in particular the wonderful article [salabim: discrete event simulation and animation in Python](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/salabim%3A-discrete-event-simulation-and-animation-in-Ham/b513ce3d7cd56c478bb045d7080f7e34c0eb20de). `salabims`s excellent documentation and wonderful examples made this project possible after all. `kalasim` reimplements all core APIs of `salabim` in a more typesafe API while also providing better test coverage, real-time capabilities and (arguably) more modern built-in support for visualization.

`kalasim`  is built on top of some great libraries. It was derived as merger of ideas, implementation and documentation from the following projects

* [DSOL3](https://simulation.tudelft.nl/simulation/index.php/dsol) which is an open source, Java based suite of Java classes for continuous and discrete event simulation
* <https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin> which is a pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers
* [apache-commons-math](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) for stats and distributions
* <https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kravis> which implements a grammar to create a wide range of plots using a standardized set of verbs

* [DSOL](https://simulation.tudelft.nl/simulation/index.php/dsol)  - a powerful simulation framework written in java covering not just discrete event but also continuous simulations
       * [DSOL3 Manual](https://simulation.tudelft.nl/dsol/manual/)
       *  [The DSOL simulation suite - Enabling multi-formalism simulation in a distributed context](https://simulation.tudelft.nl/files/dissertations/tpm_jacobs_20051115.pdf) PhD Thesis, Peter Jacobs, 2005
