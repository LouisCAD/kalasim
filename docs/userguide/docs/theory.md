# Simulation Theory

## What is discrete event simulation?

A tool to study the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as
* Factories
* Ports & Airports
* Traffic
* Supply chains & Logistics
* Controlling

In fact, every process that is founded on discrete state changes is suitable to be simulatied with a discrete event simulation such as `kalasim`.

Typical applications of discrete event simulations are
* Production planning
* Dimensioning (How many driver are needed? Numer of servers?)
* Process automation & visualization
* Digital twin development

## Other Simulation Tools

There are too many to be listed. In generally there are graphical tools and APIs
 . Graphical tools, such as [AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com/) excel by providing a flat learning curve, great visuals but often lack interfaces for extensibility or automation. APIs are more usually highly flexible but often lack an intuitive approach to actually build simulations.

Out of the great number of APIs, we [pinpoint](about.md#acknowledgements) just  those projects/products which served as source of inspiration when developing `kalasim`.
