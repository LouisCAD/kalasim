`kalasim` is a discrete event simulator. It provides a statically typed API, dependency injection, modern persistence, structured logging and automation capabilities.

kalasim is designed for simulation practitioners, process analysts and industrial engineers, who need to go beyond the limitations of existing simulation tools to model and optimize their business-critical use-cases.

In contrast to many other simulation tools, `kalasim` is neither low-code nor no-code. It is _code-first_ to enable change tracking, scaling, refactoring, CI/CD, unit-tests, and the rest of the gang that makes simulation development fun.
